    <h2>Our American brothers and sisters.</h2>
    <p>
      For decades the terrorist regime of Islamic republic has been adopting an
      aggressive propaganda campaign to convince the Iranian people that
      Americans are the enemy and to spread hatred between people of the two
      countries. But despite all efforts, the people of Iran, love your country
      and your people. We appreciate everything you have done so far in support
      of our Woman-Life-Freedom revolution. You were Iran’s voice, when the
      voices of Iranian people were being suppressed. When those who shouted
      these three words were imprisoned, tortured, raped and killed.
    </p>

    <p>
      We ask you good American people to be our voice once again. As you know,
      during this world cup event, the Iranians are being pressured and
      prevented from speaking about the ongoing violation of human rights in
      their country by the Qatar police with direct orders from the Islamic
      Republic Regime which could cost people their lives and freedom when they
      return home.

    <h2>If you want to help us, this is how:</h2>

    <h3>
      Step 1: once you’ve read this letter, pass it on to the person next to you
    </h3>

    <h3>Step 2: Grab any piece of paper, make it into a paper plane.</h3>
    <h3>Step 3: On one wing write: Love conquers Hate. Iran ♥️America</h3>
    

    <h3>On the other wing write: Woman-Life-Freedom</h3>
    
    <p>If you don’t have a pen or pencil on you, just throw the paper plane without writing. Hopefully the rest of the planes will carry your message ;)</p>

    <h3>
      Step 4: At the exact time of 22’:22” (minute 22 second 22*) throw the
      paper planes as far as you can, hoping it to reach the playground.
    </h3>
    
    Thank you and Good luck
    <p>

      beaten to death whilst in police custody for not wearing her headscarf
      correctly; which subsequently kick started the woman-life-freedom
      revolution.
